If the cloud was charged with about 10.0 C of charge, how much energy would be held in the electric field between the cloud and the earth? If there was a lightning strike that depleted the entire charge, do you think the tree would survive? (You can model a large oak tree as about 2000kg of water. One kg of water requires 2257 kJ to bring it to vaporize it ).\n"
